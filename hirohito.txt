Hirohito was the head of state under the Meiji Constitution during Japan's imperial expansion, militarization, and involvement in World War
 II. Japan waged a war across Asia in the 1930s and 40s in the name of Hirohito,[3] who was revered as a god.[4] After Japan's surrender, 
he was not prosecuted for war crimes, as General Douglas MacArthur thought that an ostensibly cooperative emperor would help establish a
 peaceful Allied occupation, and help the U.S. achieve their postwar objectives.[5] His role during the war remains controversial. On 1
 January 1946, under pressure from the Allies, the Emperor formally renounced his divinity.[6] The Constitution of Japan of 1947 declared
 the Emperor to be a mere "symbol of the State ... deriving his position from the will of the people in whom resides sovereign power."[6]
