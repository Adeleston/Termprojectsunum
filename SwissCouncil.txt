The Federal Council (German: Bundesrat; French: Conseil fédéral; Italian: Consiglio federale; Romansh: Cussegl federal) is the executive
body of the federal government of the Swiss Confederation and serves as the collective head of state and government of Switzerland. 
It meets in the west wing of the Federal Palace in Bern.
While the entire Federal Council is responsible for leading the federal administration of Switzerland, each Councillor heads one of
the seven federal executive departments. The position of President of the Swiss Confederation rotates among the seven Councillors on
a yearly basis, with one year's Vice President of Switzerland becoming the next year's President of Switzerland. Ignazio Cassis has
been the incumbent officeholder since 1 January 2022.
