Fritz Erich Georg Eduard von Manstein (born Fritz Erich Georg Eduard von Lewinski; 24 November 1887 – 9 June 1973) was a German Field 
Marshal of the Wehrmacht during the Second World War, who was subsequently convicted of war crimes and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment.
Born into an aristocratic Prussian family with a long history of military service, Manstein joined the army at a young age and saw service
 on both the Western and Eastern Front during the First World War (1914–18). He rose to the rank of captain by the end of the war and was 
active in the inter-war period helping Germany rebuild its armed forces. In September 1939, during the invasion of Poland at the beginning
 of the Second World War, he was serving as Chief of Staff to Gerd von Rundstedt's Army Group South. Adolf Hitler chose Manstein's strategy
 for the invasion of France of May 1940, a plan later refined by Franz Halder and other members of the OKH.
