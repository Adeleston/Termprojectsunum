Harry S. Truman[b] (May 8, 1884 â€“ December 26, 1972) was the 33rd president of the United States, serving from 1945 to 1953.
A leader of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 34th vice president from January to April 1945 under Franklin
Roosevelt and as a United States senator from Missouri from 1935 to January 1945. Assuming the presidency after Roosevelt's 
death, Truman implemented the Marshall Plan to rebuild the economy of Western Europe and established both the Truman Doctrine
and NATO to contain the expansion of Soviet communism. He proposed numerous liberal domestic reforms, but few were enacted by
the conservative coalition that dominated the Congress.
