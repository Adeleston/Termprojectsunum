The Russian Empire dominated the Grand Duchy of Finland before 1917, and Mannerheim made a career in the Imperial Russian Army, rising by
1917 to the rank of lieutenant general. He had a prominent place in the ceremonies for Emperor Nicholas II's coronation in 1896 and later
had several private meetings with the Tsar. After the Bolshevik revolution of November 1917 in Russia, Finland declared its independence
(6 December 1917) – but soon became embroiled in the 1918 Finnish Civil War between the pro-Bolshevik "Reds" and the "Whites", who were 
the troops of the Senate of Finland, supported by troops of the German Empire. A Finnish delegation appointed Mannerheim as the military
chief of the Whites in January 1918.[citation needed] Mannerheim was appointed as Commander-in-Chief of the country's armed forces in 
November 1939 after the Soviet invasion of Finland. He personally participated in the planning of Operation Barbarossa[5] and led the 
Finnish Defence Forces in an invasion of the USSR alongside Nazi Germany known as the Continuation War (1941–1944). In 1944, when the 
prospect of Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II became clear, the Finnish Parliament appointed Mannerheim as President of Finland, and
he oversaw peace-negotiations with the Soviet Union and the UK. He resigned from the presidency in 1946 and died in 1951
