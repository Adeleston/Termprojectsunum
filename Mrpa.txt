Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (Persian: محمدرضا پهلوی, pronounced [mohæmˈmæd reˈzɒː pæhlæˈviː]; 26 October 1919 – 27 July 1980),
[1] also known as Mohammad Reza Shah (محمدرضا شاه), was the last Shah (King) of the Imperial State of Iran from 16 September
1941 until his overthrow in the Iranian Revolution on 11 February 1979. Owing to his status, he was usually known as the Shah.
Mohammad Reza Shah took the title Shahanshah ("King of Kings")[2] on 26 October 1967 and held several other titles, including
 that of Aryamehr ("Light of the Aryans") and Bozorg Arteshtaran ("Commander-in-Chief"). He was the second and last monarch of
 the House of Pahlavi. His dream of what he referred to as a "Great Civilization" (Persian: تمدن بزرگ, romanized: tamadon-e bozorg)
 in Iran led to a rapid industrial and military modernization, as well as economic and social reforms.[3][4]
