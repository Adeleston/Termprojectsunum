Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin[g] (born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili;[d] 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1878[1] – 5 March 1953)
 was a Georgian revolutionary and Soviet political leader who led the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953. He held 
power as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922–1952) and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the
 Soviet Union (1941–1953). Initially governing the country as part of a collective leadership, he consolidated power to become a 
dictator by the 1930s. Ideologically adhering to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, he formalised these ideas as Marxism–Leninism
, while his own policies are called Stalinism.
