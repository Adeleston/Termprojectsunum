Rashid Ali al-Gaylani[note 1] (Arabic: رشيد عالي الکَيلاني, Arabic pronunciation: [raʃiːd ʕaːliː al.keːlaːniː]) (1892 – 28 August 1965)
 was an Iraqi politician who served as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Iraq on three occasions: from March to November 1933, from
 March 1940 to February 1941 and from April to May 1941. He is chiefly remembered as an ardent Arab nationalist who attempted to remove
 the British influence from Iraq by starting a coup against the government in 1941. During his brief tenures as Prime Minister in 1940 
and 1941, he attempted to negotiate settlements with the Axis powers during World War II in order to counter British influence in Iraq.
